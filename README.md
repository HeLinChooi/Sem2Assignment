# FRIEND ZONE 
## UM Data Structure Course Assignment
#### Introduction
The Anti-Couple Party (ACP) has come up with a new plan to destroy the market of couples. Many
couples were born in online dating applications such as Tinder and Tantan. As a member of ACP, I will
never let this continue. Now listen carefully, here is the Friend Zone plan... 

#### Plans
1. Make a fake dating app
1. Authentication
1. Encryption
1. Find nearby users based on geographical location
1. Users with same interests  
Now you have a list of users nearby. You need to sort those users by the similarity in terms of interests.  
You can set your own weightage; the easiest way is to increment score by 1 when there is a similar
interest between two users. Justify your resultant sorted list when presenting your feature.  
By the wayâ€¦ let the user choose the gender of users they are interested in to avoid any issues.
1. Troll Message Feature  
Your program has a dictionary of words and their antonyms. When a user
sends a message to another user, the message content will be converted to antonyms if possible. For
example, LittleSugar sent a message to Guy X:

> LittleSugar: You are so handsome!!!  

The message will then be converted to:  
> LittleSugar: You are so ugly!!!
